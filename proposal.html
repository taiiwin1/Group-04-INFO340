        <h2>Problem Description</h2>
        <p>At the University of Washington, a diverse array of talented students excels in creating handmade products ranging from crocheted items to paintings. However, the opportunity for these students to showcase their skills and connect with consumers is confined to the quarterly Maker Fair. This limitation hampers their ability to reach a wider audience of UW consumers and promote their goods effectively throughout the year. There is a clear need for an online platform that provides year-round accessibility, enabling students to interact with buyers within the UW community beyond the confines of physical events like the Maker Fair.</p>

        <h2>Proposed Application</h2>
        <p>To address this problem, we propose the development of "UW Maker Exchange," a specialized online platform tailored for University of Washington students to showcase and sell their handmade crafts and goods. This web application will serve as a centralized marketplace where student makers can upload their products and engage with fellow students who are interested in purchasing unique, locally-made items. "UW Maker Exchange" aims to democratize access to market opportunities, empowering student makers to reach a wider audience and fostering a sense of community within the campus.</p>

            <h3>Functionality Walkthrough</h3>
            <p>Upon accessing the "UW Maker Exchange" platform, users will have the ability to explore a curated selection of handmade goods and crafts created by fellow UW students. They can filter products by categories or price, and search for specific items by name, enhancing their product discovery experience. Student sellers can upload their products to the platform, including detailed information such as descriptions, images, pricing, categories, and availability status. Additionally, users will have the option to bookmark items to create wishlists for future reference or purchasing consideration. Through these features, "UW Maker Exchange" aims to provide a seamless and engaging online marketplace that connects student makers with the UW community, bridging the gap between creators and consumers while promoting diversity and inclusion within the campus ecosystem.</p>
