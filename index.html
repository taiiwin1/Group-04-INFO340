        <h2>Problem Description</h2>
        <p>At the University of Washington, a diverse array of talented students excels in creating handmade products ranging from crocheted items to paintings. However, the opportunity for these students to showcase their skills and connect with consumers is confined to the quarterly Maker Fair. This limitation hampers their ability to reach a wider audience of UW consumers and promote their goods effectively throughout the year. There is a clear need for an online platform that provides year-round accessibility, enabling students to interact with buyers within the UW community beyond the confines of physical events like the Maker Fair.</p>
