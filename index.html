        <h2>Problem Description</h2>
        <p>University of Washington students possess immense talent in creating handmade products, ranging from crocheted items to paintings. However, their opportunities to showcase these creations to fellow students and potential customers are limited to the quarterly Maker Fair held on campus. This infrequency poses a challenge for student makers to interact with a broader audience and promote their goods effectively throughout the year. There is a clear need for an online platform that can provide year-round accessibility, allowing students to connect with buyers within the UW community beyond the confines of physical events.

        <h2>Proposed Application</h2>
        <p>To address this problem, we propose the development of "UW Maker Exchange," an online platform tailored specifically for University of Washington students to showcase and sell their handmade crafts and goods. This web application will serve as a centralized marketplace where student makers can upload their products and engage with fellow students who are interested in purchasing unique, locally-made items. "UW Maker Exchange" aims to democratize access to market opportunities, empowering student makers to reach a wider audience and fostering a sense of community within the campus.

            <h3>Functionality Walkthrough</h3>
            <p>Upon accessing the "UW Maker Exchange" platform, users will have the ability to search for products using keywords or filter options such as price range and product type, enabling them to easily find items of interest. Student sellers can create profiles and upload detailed listings of their products, including descriptions, images, pricing, categories, and availability status. The platform will facilitate communication between buyers and sellers, allowing for inquiries, negotiations, and arrangements regarding purchases and transactions. Users can also leave feedback and reviews on products they've purchased, contributing to the credibility and trustworthiness of the platform. Through these features, "UW Maker Exchange" aims to provide a seamless and engaging online marketplace that connects student makers with the UW community, bridging the gap between creators and consumers while promoting diversity and inclusion within the campus ecosystem.
